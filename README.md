#__Machine Learning Projects for FreeCodeCamp Developer Certification__

Description of each task:
1. __Book Recommendation Engine using KNN__
     
     Using the Nearest Neighbors algorithm from sklearn to calculate a book's top 5 neighbors based on its collected ratings.
   
2. __Cat and Dog Image Classifier__

     Building the neural network that classify images of cats or dogs. Using ImageDataGenerator from tensorflow.keras allows to read/decode images and convert them into floating point tensors. Model constructed with Convolutional base (Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers) and with the extracted image features the fully-connected Dense layers output the lcass probability. 
   
3. __Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator__
   
   Using a regression algorithm to predict healthcare expenses from a set of basic personal information including age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habit and region of residency. Categorical data are replaced with numeric values. Model is constructed using the Keras API from TensorFlow.  

4. __Neural Network SMS Text Classifier__

   Classifying SMS messages as either spam or ham with machine learning model. Texts was preprocessed using One-Hot Encoding method.
